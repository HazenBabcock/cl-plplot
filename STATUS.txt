Current:

05/05/15: Lisp examples updated to match all the C examples in PLplot 5.11.0.
	  Added the additional functions in the PLplot API that are used in
	  the examples.

12/13/14: Added demo of how to use the Cairo driver in a GTK application.
	  This requires cl-cffi-gtk and is located in the cl-cffi-gtk-plot
	  directory.

07/05/14: Added demo of how to use the Qt driver in a Qt application. This
          requires commonqt and is located in the commonqt-plot directory.

05/06/14: Lisp examples updated to match all the C examples in PLplot 5.10.0.

02/16/14: Bindings and examples now compatible with PLplot 5.10.0.

01/24/14: Switched VCS to git.

08/10/10: Released version 0.6.0.
    
08/10/10: Added Lisp versions of PLplot examples 1 to 32. Added the additional 
          functions in the PLplot 5.9.6 API that are used in these examples.

06/20/10: Added the (documented) functions in the PLplot 5.9.6 API.

01/13/09: Added the clg-plot package to cl-plplot. This package combines cl-plplot 
          and clg. It demonstrates how to combine GTK and PLplot to make a simple 
          plotting window that handles resizing and redrawing itself. It requires 
          PLplot version 5.9.1 with the extcairo driver.

02/23/08: Released version 0.5.0.

01/21/08: Added support for 3D text rendering. PLplot version 5.8.0 is now required.

02/25/07: Released version 0.4.0.

12/08/06: Added 3D plots to cvs :cl-plplot.

10/28/06: Released version 0.3.0.

10/15/06: Added documentation of cl-plplot.

10/08/06: Added contour plots to cvs :cl-plplot, along with a number of other 
          improvements including trapping PLplot when it tries to call exit() & generic 
          plot objects.

08/19/06: Released version 0.2.0.

07/04/06: Checked in a new CLOS based approach for making 2D graphs. Hopefully this 
          will be both easier to use and more powerful than my previous attempt at a 
          Lisp front end for PLplot.

05/13/06: Released version 0.1.0.

04/01/06: The source code for this project is now available for cvs checkout. Currently 
          it includes bindings for all the graphing functions in the PLplot API as well 
          as a simple layer to facilitate making 2D graphs from lisp arrays.
