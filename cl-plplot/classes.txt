The classes & their role:

1. text-item. This contains the text to be drawn and how to draw it, i.e. size, color, font, superscript, subscript, etc...

2. text-label. This specifies where (in world coordinates inside the graph) and
at what orientation to draw a text-item object.

3. axis-label. This specifies where and at what orientation to draw a text-item
as a label on the axis of a graph.

4. axis. This specifies the properties of an axis of the graph, including
axis-labels.

5. plot. This is a shell class for x-y-plot, bar-graph, etc...

6. x-y-plot. This specifies the data and how to draw it for a "standard" 2D
graph, i.e. lines, points, error bars, etc...

7. bar-graph. Not yet implemented.

8. window. This specifies the window in which to draw the graph, including
axises and plots.


Class Layout:

window
  axis (x & y)
    axis-label (m)
      text-item (m)
  axis-label (title)
  plot (n)
  text-labels (o)
    text-item (o)

In words: the window class contains several other classes that it calls on to
draw the window. The x & y axises tell window how to draw the box that 
surrounds the plotting area. The axises in turn may have an arbitrary number
of labels which will also be drawn onto the window. The title of the plot is
also handled by an axis-label object. A window can have an arbitrary number
of plots associated with it, each of which will be draw inside the windows
plotting area. A window can also have an arbitrary number of text labels
associated with it which will be draw inside the window.
