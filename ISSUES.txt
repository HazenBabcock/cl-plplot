1) "xwin" driver - If you click on the X to close the window your Lisp process will probably
     crash. The xwin driver is supposed to catch this X windows signal, but this does not seem
     to happen with Lisp (or at least SBCL anyway). This is not an issue for standalone C
     programs.

   Workaround - Click on the window and hit the return key.
