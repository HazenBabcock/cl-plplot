; Known issues based on testing with SBCL v1.1.14.49, PLplot 5.9.11

1) "xwin" driver - If you click on the X to close the window your Lisp process will probably
   crash. The xwin driver is supposed to catch this X windows signal, but this does not seem
   to happen with Lisp (or at least SBCL anyway). This is not an issue for standalone C
   programs.

   Workaround - Click on the window and hit the return key.


2) "xcairo" driver - I believe that this was broken by r10329 of PLplot, but I've not been
   able to identify why.

   "pngcairo" driver - Gives a SB-SYS:MEMORY-FAULT-ERROR (like the "xcairo" driver).

   The other file based drivers ("epscairo", "pdfcairo", "pscairo", "svgcairo") all seem to
   work ok. I've not tested the "extcairo" or the "memcairo" devices recently.

   Workaround - The "qtwidget" driver works well..
